        .about-description
            p Hey there! I'm <span>Fatrini Nurrahmah</span>, a frontend developer with 1 year of experience based in Bandung. I have been working at Xtremax, which is an IT consulting company in Bandung. Currently, I'm looking for a new job since I was laid off in October 2023 (I hope this tech winter will be over soon). 
            p In my previous job I was involved in a slicing project, mostly using Pug, SCSS, and jQuery to develop the frontend side. I work closely with backend developer to modify templates or perform maintenance. I was also involved in another project to help with the migration to Vue 3. For more information about my frontend experience, please refer to my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatrini-nurrahmah-2b274a252">LinkedIn</a>.
            p After gaining experience in real project I realized that there are various tech stack that developers use to build a website. So now, I am trying to learn and practice some of the stacks to use in my personal project. You can have a look at the <a href="/projects.html">projects page</a> or my <a href="https://github.com/fnurrahmah125">GitHub</a> to see what I have learned so far.
            p I am really hoping to continue my career in software development. I hope that everyone who visits this website knows how much I've learned about web development.
            p You can get in touch with me via <span>LinkedIn</span> or <span>email</span> below.
